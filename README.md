I made the blackJackGame, exitWindow, blackJackRules. 
blackJackGame is the main functionality of one of the Arcade Games - BlackJack.

## Special Instructions and Guide to Compile
Special Instructions:
To use the socket functionality, two terminals are necessary. One terminal needs
to compile and run "RecieveData.java" and the other compiles and runs the program
as normal. When the user submits their score in a game at the end, the program
automatically sends the data to "RecieveData.java" which then places it in a file.
Every time you wish to submit a score do this you need to run "RecieveData.java"
again.
<br />
<br />

Please use the IDE Netbeans (https://netbeans.org/) to properly compile this program. <br />
To download the repository: click the green "Clone or download button" on the URL: https://github.com/seanacald/2020_FinalProj/tree/master. <br />
Then open Netbeans, and go to File -> Open Project -> then open then navigate to where you saved the repository and open
the "Titlescreen" project. <br />
On the left hand side you will see a window called "Projects". You should now see the "Titlescreen project". <br />
Open the "Titlescreen" project, then navigate to "Source Packages", "titlescreen" and you will see all the .java files. <br />
To start the main program, open "TitleScreen.java" (by double clicking the file in the "Projects" window).  <br />
You should now see the code in the center of your screen. To run this code, click the green play button at the top of your window. <br />
To start the socket part of the program, look back over at the "Projects" window on the left side, and open "RecieveData.java". <br />
To properly ensure the code is properly executed, click the Hammer and Broom icon (to the left of the Play Button), or 
you can press SHIFT+F11. <br />
Once that is finished, to run this file, right click anywhere on the code and select: "Run File" (or press SHIFT+F6).<br />

To view where the data from the socket is saved, navigate through to: "TitleScreen\src\titlescreen\scores". <br />
If you would like to view the code individually, navigate through to: "TitleScreen\src\titlescreen", and select whichever .java file you'd like. <br />
